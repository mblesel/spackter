# This is the default spack configuration file.
#
# Settings here are versioned with Spack and are intended to provide
# sensible defaults out of the box. Spack maintainers should edit this
# file to keep it current.
#
# Users can override these settings by editing
# `$SPACK_ROOT/etc/spack/concretizer.yaml`, `~/.spack/concretizer.yaml`,
# or by adding a `concretizer:` section to an environment.
